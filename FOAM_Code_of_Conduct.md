# Code of Conduct for Local Community Leaders and Moderators


### FOAM is dedicated to growing a vibrant and global community that is inclusive to all by establishing a friendly and welcoming environment. 

## Precautions and Safety Measures

Due to the nature of the unregulated environment around cryptocurrencies, a few rules are also in place to be regulatory compliant and to help protect the community from scam attacks:

- The FOAM token sale is not to be referenced as an ICO. You may call it a “token sale.”
- It is important that the group description and pinned message contains the message, “All official information will originate from the official FOAM Telegram group, Announcement Channel, and other official FOAM social media outlets." This message should be in both English and the local language if applicable. It is also a good idea to include a short description of the project in the local language if applicable
- FOAM’s utility token is exactly that - a utility token, not an investment vehicle. The local communities and official group are for discussion of the protocol and its utility. Speculation should not be conducted in the local communities or official FOAM group.


## Conflicts of Interest

Many of you and members of your communities are likely involved with other blockchain projects and companies. While it is okay to discuss other projects in relation to FOAM, FOAM should not be used as a medium to advertise other projects or companies. In general, keep discussion on topic and ask people to take discussion to DM if needed.

## Community Guidelines

In order to ensure that the local communities and the official group are a friendly and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, race, or religion, please follow and enforce these guidelines: 

- Be friendly and welcoming
- Be patient and understanding
  - Keep in mind that everyone communicates differently and people may not be using their native language.
- In general, be respectful of differentiating opinions
  - Do not argue, but instead try to understand others’ viewpoints
- Avoid destructive behavior:
  - Nonconstructive criticism is unproductive and leads to an endless negative feedback loop. Instead try to encourage thoughtful discussion and make points with facts in a friendly manner.
  - Off-topic discussion is acceptable in the local communities, but discussion of potentially offensive or sensitive issues can lead to unnecessary conflict. If discussion of a controversial topic begins, guide the discussion back to FOAM, ping a team member, and if the problem persists, it is okay to mute members until the problem can be resolved.

Expect misunderstandings to happen, and be prepared to help de-escalate conflict when it arises. People have different opinions, and that is alright. However, it is important that discussion between differentiating opinions happens in a constructive manner. Above all, be friendly. A friendly environment will harbor more growth, activity, and good discussion. A great way to ensure this happens is to welcome new members and ask them what they are interested in about FOAM. Ask if they plan to develop on top of the FOAM Protocol, or if they can use FOAM in their profession.

There are times when bans may be required. These are examples of some of the situations that may warrant a ban:

- Immediate bans include: a user posting a "free coins/money" referral link, phishing attack, pump & dump group, or impersonating an admin or team member.
- Warn a user for crude comments/messages and delete the message. If someone posts personal attacks, blatant discrimination, or continues to cause problems after being warned, ban the user
- In general, use your best judgement. Some actions should only require a warning, and some obviously deserve a ban.
- If you are unsure if someone’s actions should warrant a ban, temporarily ban or mute the user, let them know why, and contact a team member.
